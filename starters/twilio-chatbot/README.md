## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- ngrok (for tunneling)
- Twilio Account

## Installation

1. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Create .env**:
   Copy the example environment file and update with your settings:

   ```sh
   cp env.example .env
   ```

4. **Install ngrok**:
   Follow the instructions on the [ngrok website](https://ngrok.com/download) to download and install ngrok.

## Configure Twilio URLs

1. **Start ngrok**:
   In a new terminal, start ngrok to tunnel the local server:

   ```sh
   ngrok http 8765
   ```

2. **Update the Twilio Webhook**:

   - Go to your Twilio phone number's configuration page
   - Under "Voice Configuration", in the "A call comes in" section:
     - Select "Webhook" from the dropdown
     - Enter your ngrok URL (e.g., http://<ngrok_url>)
     - Ensure "HTTP POST" is selected
   - Click Save at the bottom of the page

3. **Configure streams.xml**:
   - Copy the template file to create your local version:
     ```sh
     cp templates/streams.xml.template templates/streams.xml
     ```
   - In `templates/streams.xml`, replace `<your server url>` with your ngrok URL (without `https://`)
   - The final URL should look like: `wss://abc123.ngrok.io/ws`

## Running the Application

```sh
# Make sure you’re in the project directory and your virtual environment is activated
python server.py
```

## Usage

To start a call, simply make a call to your configured Twilio phone number. The webhook URL will direct the call to your FastAPI application, which will handle it accordingly.
